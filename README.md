# PCjs Machines

Welcome to PCjs, home of [PCx86](/machines/pcx86/), the original IBM PC simulation that runs in your web browser.

It is one of several JavaScript Machines in this project that span a variety of devices:

  - [6502-based Microcomputers](/machines/osi/c1p/)
  - [8080-based Microcomputers](/machines/pcx80/)
  - [Arcade Machines](/machines/arcade/invaders/)
  - [DEC Minicomputers and Terminals](/machines/dec/)
  - [IBM PC and PC Compatibles](/machines/pcx86/)
  - [Texas Instruments Programmable Calculators](/machines/ti/)
  - [LED Simulations](/machines/led/)

along with a small collection of software used for archival/demonstration purposes only.

To learn more about what you can do with the repository (besides simply browsing it), see the [PCjs Wiki](/jeffpar/pcjs.org/wiki).
