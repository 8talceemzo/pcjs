See the [PC Hard Drive Types](/configs/pcx86/hdc/) supported by PCjs.

NOTE: Although IBM's preferred term at the time was "Fixed Disk," the more common term became Hard Disk.  Also, like
floppy drives and floppy disks, fixed disks were simply the combination of a drive enclosure (with a specific drive type) and
some non-removable disk media.  So, if it makes sense to talk about those components separately, we usually refer to the
enclosure as the hard drive and the media as the hard disk (or hard disk image, if referring to the contents of the media).
