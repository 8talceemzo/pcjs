Well, not really.

This new version of [pcjs.org](https://www.pcjs.org) isn't quite ready yet, so head over [there](https://www.pcjs.org) and ignore this site for now.

When everything has been migrated, and the new PCjs Explorer is finished, this will become the new pcjs.org, so don't bother bookmarking anything here
(do people still bookmark things anyway?)

Thanks,
Jeff

Welcome to PCjs, home of **PCx86**, the original IBM PC emulator that runs in your web browser.
We try to recreate the complete IBM PC experience, using original ROMs, CPUs running at their
original speeds, and early IBM video cards and monitors, including the classic green monochrome MDA
monitor and the venerable "flickery" CGA monitor.

Over time, PCjs Machines have slowly expanded to include [PC Clones](/machines/pcx86/compaq/deskpro386/),
[Minicomputers](/machines/dec/pdp11/), [Programmable Calculators](/machines/ti/ti57/), [Terminals](/machines/dec/vt100/),
[Arcade Games](/machines/arcade/invaders/), and [LED Simulations](/machines/led/life/color/).
To learn more, visit the [PCjs]({{ site.github.repository_url }}) open-source project on [GitHub]({{ site.github.owner_url }}).

### PCjs Highlights

A few hand-picked PCjs Machines are highlighted below, featuring hardware or software that's historically interesting.

The [PCjs Explorer](#pcjs-explorer) offers many more hardware and software combinations to choose from, as well as a small
collection of related documentation.
