PCjs uses JavaScript to recreate the IBM PC experience, using original ROMs, CPUs running at their original speeds,
and early IBM video cards and monitors, including the classic green monochrome MDA monitor and the venerable "flickery" CGA monitor.

Over time, PCjs emulations have expanded to include selected [PC Compatibles](/machines/pcx86/compaq/deskpro386/) and more
classic machines, such as [Minicomputers](/machines/dec/pdp11/), [Programmable Calculators](/machines/ti/ti57/), [Terminals](/machines/dec/vt100/),
and [Arcade Games](/machines/arcade/invaders/).
