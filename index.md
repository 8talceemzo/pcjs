Well, almost.

I haven't quite finished migrating all the content from [pcjs.org](https://www.pcjs.org) yet, so head over there and ignore this site for now.

When pcjs.dev is ready, it will become the new pcjs.org, so don't bother bookmarking anything here (do people still bookmark things anyway?)

Thanks,
Jeff

## What's New?

The main goals are:

- Simplify the structure of the site, improve usability, and minimize fragility
- Make it easier to find the [Hardware](/configs/hardware.json), [Software](/configs/software.json) and [Documents](/configs/documents.json) you're looking for
- Reduce the number of hardware configurations and make machines easier to reconfigure
- Do a better job automatically launching software on the appropriate hardware

One of the new features that's central to these goals is the PCjs Explorer, which allows you to quickly navigate all the site's content without having to click through page after page.

The PCjs Explorer isn't fully populated yet, but it will be before it goes "live" on pcjs.org.
