Well, not really.

This new version of [pcjs.org](https://www.pcjs.org) isn't quite ready yet, so head over [there](https://www.pcjs.org) and ignore this site for now.

When everything has been migrated, and the new PCjs Explorer is finished, this will become the new pcjs.org, so don't bother bookmarking anything here
(do people still bookmark things anyway?)

Thanks,
Jeff

### PCjs Highlights

A few hand-picked PCjs Machines are highlighted below, which feature hardware or software that we found engaging
either at the time or years later.

The [PCjs Explorer](#pcjs-explorer) offers many more hardware and software combinations to choose from, as well as a small
collection of related documentation.
