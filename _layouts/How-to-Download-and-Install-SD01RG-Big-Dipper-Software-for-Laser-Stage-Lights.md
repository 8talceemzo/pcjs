In this article, we will show you how to download and install the SD01RG software step by step, and how to use it to create your own laser shows.
 
## Step 1: Download the SD01RG software
 
The SD01RG software is available on the official website of Big Dipper Laser Science And Technology Co., Ltd., which is a leading manufacturer of laser stage lights in China. You can find the download link on their product page for the SD01RG double head laser stage light[^4^]. Alternatively, you can use this direct link[^1^] to download the software.
 
The software is a zip file that contains the installation file and a user manual. You will need to unzip the file before you can install it.
 
## Step 2: Install the SD01RG software
 
Once you have unzipped the file, you will see an executable file named "SD01RG\_Setup.exe". Double-click on it to start the installation process. You will see a welcome screen that asks you to choose a language. Select your preferred language and click "Next".
 
Then, you will see a license agreement screen that asks you to accept the terms and conditions. Read them carefully and click "I Agree" if you agree. Then, you will see a destination folder screen that asks you to choose where to install the software. You can use the default location or browse to another folder. Click "Next" when you are done.
 
Finally, you will see a ready to install screen that shows you a summary of your choices. Click "Install" to start installing the software. Wait for a few minutes until the installation is complete. Then, click "Finish" to exit the installer.
 
## Step 3: Connect your SD01RG laser stage light to your computer
 
Before you can use the SD01RG software, you need to connect your SD01RG laser stage light to your computer with a USB cable. Make sure your computer has a free USB port and your laser stage light is turned on.
 
Once you have connected your device, you may need to install a driver for it. The driver is included in the zip file that you downloaded earlier. You can find it in a folder named "Driver". Double-click on the file named "PL2303\_Prolific\_DriverInstaller\_v1.19.0.exe" to start installing the driver. Follow the instructions on the screen until the driver is installed.

You will see a main interface that consists of several sections: a menu bar, a toolbar, a preview window, a timeline, and a status bar. You can use these sections to create, edit, save, load, and play your laser shows.
 
The user manual that comes with the software explains how to use each section in detail. You can also find some tutorials and examples on the Big Dipper website[^4^] or on their YouTube channel. You can learn how to use different modes, effects, colors, patterns, animations, texts, images, sounds, and more.
