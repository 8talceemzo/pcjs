## Information about "PC SHIFT"

    PC-SHIFT helps organize your employee shift schedule.  PC-SHIFT allows
    you to divide the jobs by location or category and then lets you
    describe each job required for each area.  The job descriptions consist
    of the beginning date, the location or department, the job title or
    description, the minimum and maximum qualification level, and the
    minimum and maximum security level.
    
    PC-SHIFT then lets you enter a schedule for each job, showing a chart of
    each hour of the day divided into 15-minute intervals.  Once all the
    data is entered, you may display or print a report on a 12-hour
    schedule, a 24-hour schedule, a 24-hour chart, or a report on all the
    job descriptions.
