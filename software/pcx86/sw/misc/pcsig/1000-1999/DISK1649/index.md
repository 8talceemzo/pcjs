## Information about "CALUTIL"

    Enhance the standard Modula-2 library with this useful toolkit.  Though
    heralded academically, Modula-2 has some noticeable short-comings,
    especially in the I/O functions arena.  CALUTIL will alleviate some of
    these difficulties.
    
    CALUTIL provides modules for improved I/O, date and calendar
    functionality, string handling, screen display, and math routines (trig.
    and log. functions).  For improved file I/O, CALUTIL comes with a model
    program to handle a sequential record datafile.  CALUTIL also provides
    an alternate programming environment that enables the user to edit,
    print, compile, link, and run a program without explicitly typing each
    command.
    
    CALUTIL comes ready for use with the Logitech Compiler, but all source
    is included so the modules can be adapted for other Modula-2
    environments.
