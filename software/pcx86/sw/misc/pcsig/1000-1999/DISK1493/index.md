## Information about "XY-SOLVE"

    Teachers will welcome this computer-aided instructional system for the
    design of tests and exercises for high school and college level
    Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry.
    
    XY-Solve challenges the student to solve a puzzle consisting of
    mathematical functions.  Each piece of the puzzle represents a graphic
    solution to a standard formula.  Puzzle complexity may be varied from
    simple displays of individual points or lines to extremely complex
    combinations of quadratics, trigonometrics, parametrics, and composite
    functions.
    
    The student's progress in solving each piece of the formula is
    displayed and special help is available for identifying boundaries and
    zeroing in on solutions.  A function teachers will appreciate is the
    performance reporting module which tracks the number of solution
    attempts by the student, and difficulty levels reached.
    
    XY-SOLVE has seventeen "puzzle files" and the instructor can formulate
    additional problems by using the macro facility.  Other system features
    include moving window displays, function-sensitive statistics, and
    context-sensitive help screens.  Data can be imported in a variety of
    formats.  Selectable sound and color options add impact to the lessons.
    An extensive on-disk instruction manual is provided.
    
    See also XYSEE (PC-SIG disk number 1507 and 1508), a companion program.
