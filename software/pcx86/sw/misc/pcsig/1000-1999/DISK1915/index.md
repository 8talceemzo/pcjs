## Information about "PULLED FROM LIBRARY"

    Personalize your Microsoft Windows environment with your own menus and
    submenus, arrange or stack open windows, close windows, iconize them,
    and hide windows by making them invisible.  If that's not enough, you
    can browse files in your Windows environment and print out whatever you
    want.
    
    This well-documented trio of microapplications makes Windows do it your
    way.  With COMMAND POST, you easily add any number of menu and submenu
    items to the main MS-DOS Windows executive menu bar.  Execution is only
    a mouse click away.  COMMAND POST does a lot more than make it easy for
    you to start programs.  It helps you get your work done faster and safer
    by reducing tedious manual steps.  A single menu item can gather
    filenames and other information into listboxes for the user to choose
    from, perform arithmetic, parse strings, move and resize windows, read
    and write WIN.INI variables, read DOS environment variables, copy, move
    and delete files and much more.
    
    While BROWSER cannot alter or edit files, you can display them in ASCII
    format.  Or you can make a hex dump.  A hide and seek feature lets users
    control the shown (displayable) and hidden lines of text.
    
    APPLETS lets you put your windows where you want them.  You can easily
    copy, rename, move and delete files with APPLETS.
