## Information about "LHARC AND UTILITIES"

    This collection of archive utilities can make you the tightest, most
    effective archiver on your block. LHARC compresses tighter than any of
    the more common compression programs. It does take a little longer, but
    sometimes space is far more important than speed. Included on this disk
    is 2LZH which converts ARC, PKARC, and ZIP files to LHARC format. LHDIR
    is a companion program for viewing and identifying compressed LHARC
    files and self-extracting LHARC.
    
    And if LHARC isn't all you need, the utility MAD (Mike's Archive
    Directory) can show you the contents of every popular archive type
    available and their self-extracting-executable (SFX) files. MAD
    currently supports ARC, PAK, ZIP, ZOO, LZS, DWC and LZH archives and all
    self-extracting .COM and .EXE files created by SEA ARC, PK-ARC, PAK, PK-
    ZIP, SEZ (zoo), LARC (lzs), DWC and LHARC (lzh).
    
    ZIPNOTE rounds out the collection as a better way to attach comments to
    ZIP files. This can be especially useful for BBS sysops who want to
    mark their ZIP files for free advertising. The flexibility in ZIPNOTE
    is that it allows a comment to be typed from the keyboard, copied from
    an existing text file, or stored in a configuration file.
