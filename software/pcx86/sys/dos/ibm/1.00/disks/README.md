Ordinarily, all disk images should be a separate repository.

However, this disk is currently an exception, because we reference it from Node test file [ibm5150.json](/machines/pcx86/bin/ibm5150.json).

Eventually, we should fix our Node test environment to fetch disk images over the network as well.
