# In the following pcjs section, setting "uncompiled: true" works only for pages with a single machine,
# because the uncompiled scripts use shared classes that can only be instantiated once on a page (unless
# they're compiled and/or wrapped inside a function).
#
# There's also an "unbundled: true" setting, but that currently doesn't work at all, because our scripts
# are designed to also run under Node, so they must be "bundled" (and all *require* statements stripped)
# to run in a browser.
