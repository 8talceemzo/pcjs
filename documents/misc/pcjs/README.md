Much like the collection of [PCjs Personal Disks](/disks/pcx86/personal/), this is an assortment of old
documents archived by [@jeffpar](https://jeffpar.com) that may or may not be of historical interest.

We're kicking off this new section of the site with a couple of documents created by [@jeffpar](https://jeffpar.com)
in 1984, detailing his early adventures in PC debugging: disassembling and disabling
[dBASE III Copy-Protection](#dbase-iii-copy-protection).

### dBASE III Copy-Protection

* [dBASE III Debugging Notes](1984-09-16--DBASE_III_DEBUG.pdf)
* [dBASE III Patching Procedure](1984-09-25--DBASE_III_PATCH.pdf)

NOTE: PCjs also has copies of the [dBASE III 1.0](/software/pcx86/app/other/dbase3/1.0) diskettes.
