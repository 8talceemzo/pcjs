Below are documents from the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/)'s [Electronic Computer Project (1946-1954)](https://www.ias.edu/electronic-computer-project),
describing the evolution of an "electronic computing instrument", which would become known as the first stored-program computer using the so-called "von Neumann architecture."

Why are these documents here?  Partly because they are historically important, but mostly because we would like to add an ECP simulation to the collection
of PCjs machines -- someday.
