We kick off the [PCjs Document Archive](/documents/papers/pcjs/) with a couple of documents [@jeffpar](https://jeffpar.com)
created in 1984, detailing his early adventures in PC debugging: disassembling and disabling [dBASE III Copy-Protection](#dbase-iii-copy-protection).

NOTE: PCjs also has copies of the [dBASE III 1.0](/software/pcx86/app/other/dbase3/1.0) diskettes.
